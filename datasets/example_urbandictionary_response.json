In fact, they probably don't even give a shit about what you just wrote.  More accurately, the acronym \"lol\" should be redefined as \"Lack of laughter.\"\n\nDepending on the [chatter], its definition may vary.  The list of its meanings includes, but is not limited to:\n1) \"I have nothing [worthwhile] to contribute to this conversation.\"\n2) \"I'm too lazy to read what you just wrote so I'm typing something useless in hopes that you'll think I'm still paying attention.\"\n3) \"Your statement lacks even the vaguest [trace] of humor but I'll pretend I'm amused.\"\n4) \"This is a pointless acronym I'm sticking in my sentence just because it's become so engraved into my mind that when chatting, I MUST use the meaningless sentence-filler 'lol.'\"\n\nSee:  lmao, lmfao, rofl, [lawl], heh, haha, [lolol], and 120 for similarities.",
